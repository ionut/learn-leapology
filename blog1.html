                <p>Taking the time to manage your finances better can really pay off (pun intended). It can help you
                  stay on
                  top of your bills and save thousands of pounds each year. You can use this extra money to pay off
                  debts,
                  put
                  them towards your pension, or (if there is quite a bit left over) spend them on a new car or
                  holiday!
                  We
                  will discuss some money management tips, including how to set up a budget, sticking to it and how to
                  save.

                <p>Arguably, the first step to taking control of your finances is making a budget.
                  Although It takes some effort, it’s a great way to get a quick overview of the money you have
                  incoming
                  and outgoing.
                </p>
                <p>Setting up a budget means you are:</p>
                <ul class="pl-4">
                  <li>Less likely to find yourself in debt</li>
                  <li>Less likely to be caught out by unexpected expenses</li>
                  <li>More likely to have a good credit rating</li>
                  <li>More likely to be accepted for a loan or mortgage</li>
                  <li>Able to spot areas where you can save money</li>
                  <li>In a better position to save up for a new car, or maybe even a holiday!</li>

                <p>Over half of UK households keep a regular budget. Most say it gives them peace of mind about how
                  much
                  they
                  are spending, and makes them feel better about life in general.
                </p>
                <p>To get started on a budget, you have to work out how much you spend on:</p>
                <ul class="pl-4">
                  <li>Living Costs</li>
                  <li>Household Bills / Expenses</li>
                  <li>Insurance</li>
                  <li>Gifts for Family and Friends</li>
                  <li>Travel Costs (Public Transport, Car, Petrol)</li>
                  <li>Leisure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are some great free budget creator tools out there online, alternatively you can set up a
                  budget
                  using a spreadsheet - or just write it all down on paper (just make sure not to lose it!)</p>
                <p>There are also some great free budgeting apps available and your bank might have an online
                  budgeting
                  tool
                  that can take the relevant information directly from your transaction history.</p>

                <p>If you’re spending more than you have coming in, you need to work out where you can scale down.
                  This
                  could
                  be through small steps like cooking your lunch at home, or cancelling that extra TV subscription you

                  really use.</p>
                <p>You could also keep some sort of spending diary and write down everything you buy weekly or
                  monthly.
                  Often
                  we spend on our cards without actually realising how much overall. Alternatively look at last

                  card statements at the end of each month.</p>

                  For many families, a lot of the money can go on unnecessary bills - try and get everyone to keeps
                  the
                  windows closed in winter when the heating is on, and not leave lights on when we leave the house.
                  Work
                  out
                  how much spending money is left after the essentials, and decide how much you can save and what is
                  left
                  to
                  spend.
                </p>
                <p>You can also save by shopping around for a new mortgage, or making adjustments to your existing
                  plan.

              <div class="paragraph-blog-p">
                <p>Everything becomes easier when we set ourselves a goal - saving money is no different. Firstly we
                  have
                  to
                  make sure we have some emergenc savings put aside that we can rely on in an unexpected emergency
                  like
                  being
                  laid off or a siblings hospital visit.</p>
                <p>A good rule of thumb is being able to save enough for 3 months of expenses if you are unable to
                  work
                  -
                  generally this could be a goal for many of us. If you can't do this straight away, even more reason
                  to
                  make
                  this a longer term goal. You can keep this in a building society or separate savings account so that
                  you
                  are
                  not tempted to spend it.</p>
                <p>As your savings start to grow, you might consider:</p>
                <ul class="pl-4">
                  <li>Putting more money into your pension. It’s a great way to take of yourself in the future.</li>
                  <li>Perhaps make an investment plan based on your personal needs/goals and the time frame you have
                    in
                  </li>

                  us. It sometimes easier just to not open the letter containing the bill than it is to stomach
