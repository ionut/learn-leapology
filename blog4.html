            <p>That’s right – often 3rd party insurance, fire and theft (TPF&T) is more expensive than fully comp.
              This is because according to insurer’s stats the cost-per accident under TPF&T insured incidents is
              often greater overall (so there is some method to their madness).

            <p>Insurers like secure cars – simple. The older the vehicle the likelihood of it being easier to steal
              goes up – however this is not always the case. For older cars, fitting them with an alarm approved by
              your insurer will help to lower your costs. For newer cars, watch out for more modern methods of theft
              such a relay attacks. In this method the criminals work in pairs using the signal from your key fob
              (often in your house) to relay it to the car and open the door. Something like an RFID signal blocking
              wallet/pouch can help counter this.

            <p>Ultimately, if you have no insurance claims, your no-claims bonus will surely keep your costs down.</p>

            <p>Especially relevant for young / new drivers. Insurance policies are often based upon the companies
              perception of the risk you and your vehicle pose. Taking a government mandated Pass Plus 6 hour extra
              driving course may encourage your insurance company to offer you a lower rate – something they can be
              tempted to do upon completing this course as they see your risk of having an accident in the first 12
              months of car ownership as having been lowered.</p>
            <p>In order to get your policy to reflect your responsibility behind the wheel rather than the perceived
              threat you pose, you may consider a ‘black-box insurance policy’. This is essentially a small device
              that gets installed near your engine to track that your are driving responsibly within the limits of
              your insurance policy. This can be useful for new drivers who may get a lower insurance premium if they
              drive responsibly. Be careful though as these policies sometimes have maximum mileage penalties – so be
              sure to read the small print.</p>
