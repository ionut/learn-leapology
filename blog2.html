                <p>Choosing the right savings account is like choosing the right tools when building something – it’s
                  important to know what you want to build before you can pick the right tools for the job. So we put
                  together a little starter guide to help you get thinking along the lines of what your goals are and
                  what
                  kinds of savings accounts could help you achieve them in the long term.

                <p>Different savings accounts have different notice periods (waiting times for you to be able to
                  withdraw
                  your funds) – therefore it’s important for you to decide if you’ll be needing your savings within
                  the
                  next 5 years or so (the typical time for longer-term savings accounts).
                  Some of the kinds of short-term savings accounts out there:
                </p>
                <ul class="pl-4">
                  <li><b>Easily accessible or even instant accounts:</b>
                    <br>
                    <p style="padding:5px 0 4px 0">Pretty good for an ‘emergency savings’ type of account as they
                      often
                      allow you to easily withdraw
                      the money without any penalties or issue.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Fixed-term deposit accounts:</b>
                    <br>
                    <p style="padding:5px 0 4px 0">The work well if there is money you absolutely don’t plan on
                      touching
                      for the next few years. Some
                      of them are for a single year or a fixed amount of time during which you will have to pay a
                      penalty
                      if you try and withdraw the money. Their savings rate is typically higher than that of the quick
                      access accounts.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Regular savings accounts:</b>
                    <br>
                    <p style="padding:5px 0 4px 0">They come in all shapes and sizes and usually are centred around
                      the
                      premise that you will deposit
                      a fixed sum of money each month. This can really help if you have a budget in mind or something
                      that
                      you need to save towards the following year (like a holiday or a wedding) – you know you will
                      hit
                      your target as long as you keep depositing the set amount monthly.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>Generally speaking, the rule goes that the longer you are
                    willing to lock
                    your money or omit to a regular savings deposit, the more favourable interest rate you will
                    receive.</em></p>
                <p><b>Pay Attention To Tax:</b></p>
                <p>Be aware that there is such a thing as a “tax-free savings allowance” – Cash ISA’s (Individual
                  Savings
                  Accounts) Allow you to save up to a certain amount (roughly £20,000) without paying any tax on the
                  interest you earn. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-blog">
              <div class="paragraph-blog-h">
                <h4>Medium-Term Savings:</h4>
              </div>
              <div class="paragraph-blog-img">
                <img class="hr" src="images/line-2.png" alt="line">
              </div>
              <div class="paragraph-blog-p">
                <p>If you can keep your savings locked away for around 2-5 years you’ll probably getter offered higher
                  interest rates on your savings. In this case you could look t fixed-rate bonds and perhaps consider
                  longer-term time periods on your chosen savings account.
                </p>
                <p>Whilst the interest rates are often higher, make sure to be aware of any potential downsides. Often
                  with these kinds of savings accounts the provider will not allow any withdrawals (within the
                  allotted
                  time frame) or sometimes not even any additional deposits. Sometimes open one of these accounts is
                  conditions upon you also open a current account with the provider – something which may not suit
                  your
                  needs. </p>
                <p>Be sure to shop around first and utilise your cash ISA limit first as it may actually give you the
                  best
                  rate available!</p>

                <p>Whilst all the options mentioned above are also available for longer time periods (simply don’t
                  withdraw your money!) there is another set of options for the longer term.</p>
                <p>If you are willing to keep your money tied up for 5+ years, investing – whilst riskier than a mere
                  savings accounts – can pay out much larger returns. The golden rule is you shouldn’t invest anything
                  that you aren’t willing to take a loss on.</p>
                <p>Stocks and shared ISAs allow you to keep the returns you make without paying tax – the risk is that
                  you
                  are invested in stocks and shares that could go down instead of just being invested in a bank.</p>
                <p>There are a myriad of other options in the world of investment out there, but we recommend you seek
                  unbiased, professional advice when looking at the options that can best suit your individual risk
                  and
                  financial needs.</p>
